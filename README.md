## The Problem

Every AI coding tool produces the same output: Inter font, purple gradients on white, centered layouts, uniform card grids, glassmorphism everywhere. It's instantly recognizable as "AI made this." Users can feel it. Clients can see it. It looks generic because it is generic.

Existing design skills are shallow. They tell you to "use good typography" without specifying what that means. They say "be accessible" without giving you the ARIA patterns. They cover 3-4 design domains and call it done.

**Picasso is different.** It is the largest, most detailed, and most opinionated design skill available for any AI coding agent. It doesn't just tell you what to do -- it tells you exactly how, with specific values, code examples, and anti-patterns for every decision.

## What Makes Picasso Different

### Depth That No Other Skill Matches

Picasso covers **32 specialized reference domains**, each with concrete rules, specific values, and ready-to-use code. This isn't a collection of vague principles -- it's an engineering specification for beautiful interfaces.

| Domain | What You Get |
|---|---|
| **Typography** | Modular type scales, 15+ font alternatives to Inter/Roboto, OpenType feature activation, vertical rhythm system, `max-width: 65ch`, font loading strategies |
| **Color & Contrast** | OKLCH-based palette construction, tinted neutrals (never pure gray), 60-30-10 rule, dark mode inversion rules, "alpha is a design smell" |
| **Spatial Design** | 4px base spacing scale, Gestalt proximity ratios (2:1 minimum), Squint Test, asymmetric grid patterns, "cards are not required" |
| **Motion & Animation** | Duration rule (100/200/300/500ms), only animate transform+opacity, exit = 75% of entrance, grid-template-rows for height, stagger caps |
| **Interaction Design** | All 8 interactive states (default/hover/focus/active/disabled/loading/error/success), dropdown positioning (#1 bug fix), Popover API, undo > confirmation |
| **Responsive Design** | Input method detection (`@media pointer/hover`), safe areas, container queries, content-driven breakpoints, real device testing |
| **Sensory Design** | soundcn (700+ CC0 sounds), web-haptics (4 presets + custom), multi-sensory integration patterns |
| **React/Next.js** | Server Components by default, barrel import avoidance, RSC serialization minimization, React.cache() deduplication |
| **Anti-Patterns** | 50+ explicit "never do this" rules across typography, color, layout, motion, interaction, code, and content |
| **Design Systems** | VoltAgent/Google Stitch 9-section DESIGN.md format, 4 pre-built themes, two-layer token architecture |
| **Generative Art** | Philosophy-first creative process, seeded randomness, p5.js patterns, parameter-driven exploration |
| **Component Patterns** | 40+ standard component names from 90+ real design systems, state matrix, compound component patterns, sizing conventions |
| **UX Psychology** | Gestalt principles with CSS examples, Fitts's/Hick's/Miller's/Jakob's Law with specific numbers, F/Z-pattern scanning, Peak-End Rule |
| **Data Visualization** | Chart selection decision matrix (13 types), dashboard layout patterns, Okabe-Ito colorblind-safe palettes, Tufte data-ink ratio, React library comparison |
| **Modern CSS** | CSS nesting, :has(), @layer, anchor positioning, @scope, @property, color-mix(), subgrid, Popover API, scroll-driven animations, View Transitions |
| **Web Performance** | Core Web Vitals targets (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms), image format matrix (AVIF/WebP), font-display strategies, critical CSS, Tailwind v4 |
| **Conversion Design** | Hero section variations, CTA design with conversion data, pricing page structure, friction reduction metrics, onboarding frameworks, notification hierarchy |
| **Accessibility** | 12 WAI-ARIA widget patterns with exact roles/states/keyboard, WCAG 2.2 new criteria, focus management for SPAs, accessible data tables, drag-and-drop alternatives |
| **UX Writing** | Error message formula (what + why + fix), button label rules (verb + object), translation expansion percentages, terminology consistency |
| **Style Presets** | 22 curated visual presets with hex values, font pairings, border-radius, and signature UI elements, mapped to moods |
| **Performance Optimization** | Vercel's 45 React/Next.js rules across 7 priority tiers with BAD/GOOD code examples |
| **Navigation Patterns** | Breadcrumbs with ARIA, sidebar collapse, tabs vs button groups, mobile bottom bar vs hamburger, sticky headers, mega menus, skip links |
| **Tables & Forms** | Sortable tables with `aria-sort`, responsive strategies, inline editing, multi-select, form validation (blur/submit/real-time), multi-step forms |
| **Loading & States** | Duration rules (<1s/1-3s/3s+/10s+), skeleton shimmer CSS, 5 empty state types, error boundaries, retry with backoff, offline detection |
| **Dark Mode** | Preference hierarchy, surface elevation (lighter = higher), mode transitions, accent adjustment, image dimming, forced-colors, autofill fix |
| **Images & Media** | AVIF/WebP/SVG decision tree, srcset/sizes, CLS prevention, favicon multi-format, OG images (1200x630), video backgrounds |
| **Micro-Interactions** | IntersectionObserver scroll animations, View Transitions API, magnetic cursors, gesture detection (swipe/pinch), animation budget (max 3 concurrent) |
| **i18n Visual Patterns** | Logical properties for RTL, text expansion by language (+35% German), CJK rendering, Noto font stacks, icon mirroring rules |

| **Animation Performance** | Compositor-only properties (transform + opacity only), will-change lifecycle, layout thrashing batching, `contain` property, GPU hints |
| **Code Typography** | JetBrains Mono/Fira Code selection, syntax highlighting contrast (3:1 min), code block design, copy button UX, diff views, terminal styling |

### The AI-Slop Firewall

Picasso's anti-pattern system is the most aggressive in any design skill. It doesn't just suggest good practices -- it explicitly bans the fingerprints of AI-generated interfaces:

**Banned typography:** Inter, Roboto, Arial, Open Sans, Space Grotesk, monospace-as-lazy-technical-vibe, large icons with rounded corners above every heading.

**Banned color:** Pure black (#000), pure white (#fff), pure gray, gray text on colored backgrounds, cyan-on-dark, purple-to-blue gradients, neon accents on dark, gradient text for "impact."

**Banned layout:** Cards nested in cards, identical card grids (icon + heading + text repeated), hero metric layout template, centered everything, same spacing everywhere, glassmorphism everywhere.

**Banned motion:** bounce/elastic easing, `transition: all`, animating width/height/padding/margin, no reduced-motion support.

**Banned interaction:** Placeholder-only labels, `outline: none` without replacement, hover-only interactions, every button styled as primary.

### Integrated Tool Ecosystem

Picasso doesn't just describe tools -- it specifies exactly how to use them with installation commands, import paths, and API examples:

| Tool | What It Does | Integration |
|---|---|---|
| **torph** | Text morphing animation | `import { TextMorph } from 'torph/react'` with spring easing |
| **soundcn** | 700+ UI sounds | `npx shadcn add @soundcn/click-soft`, base64 inline, zero deps |
| **web-haptics** | Mobile haptic feedback | 4 presets (success/nudge/error/buzz), desktop debug mode |
| **facehash** | Deterministic avatar faces | ~3KB, SVG, 3D depth, Avatar/AvatarFallback pattern |
| **better-icons** | 200K+ icons from 150+ sets | MCP server for AI agents, CLI search, project sync |
| **Geist Pixel** | 5 pixel font variants | Square/Grid/Circle/Triangle/Line, Next.js native |
| **Lucide React** | Default icon library | Direct imports (avoid barrel files) |

## The Design Interview

When you first use Picasso on a project, it doesn't just start generating. It asks.

```
Picasso: What are we building? New project, redesign, polish, or fixing specific issues?
You:     New SaaS dashboard for a fintech startup

Picasso: Who is this for?
You:     Financial analysts, 30-50 age range, use Bloomberg terminals all day

Picasso: What's the vibe? Any sites you love the look of?
You:     Dark, dense, like Linear meets Bloomberg. Here's a reference: linear.app

Picasso: Rate these 1-5:
         Animations? Mobile? Accessibility? Dark mode? Performance?
You:     Animations 3, Mobile 2, A11y 5, Dark mode YES, Perf 5

Picasso: Got it. Here's what I'm building:
         → Dark-tech aesthetic inspired by Linear
         → Dense layout (VISUAL_DENSITY: 8), subtle motion (MOTION_INTENSITY: 3)
         → WCAG AAA accessibility, dark-first, performance-critical
         → Generating .picasso.md and DESIGN.md now...
         Sound good?
```

The interview generates a `.picasso.md` config that persists your preferences across every future session. Run `/picasso` anytime to redo it.

---

## Creative Commands

These are the features that make Picasso unlike any other design tool.

### `/roast` -- The Brutally Honest Critique

Forget polite feedback. `/roast` tears your design apart with designer-Twitter energy.

```
🔥🔥🔥🔥 ROAST SCORE: 4/5

This hero section looks like every v0 output from 2024. The purple gradient
physically hurts my eyes. The three identical cards are a cry for help. And
the "Build the future of work" headline? It's 2026 -- we've moved on.

The Inter font is doing NOTHING for you. It's the design equivalent of
wearing khakis to a nightclub. And transition: all 0.3s? That's animating
your box-shadow, your border-color, and your will to live.

Here's how to fix it:
1. Kill the gradient. Use oklch(0.15 0.02 250) as your background.
2. Replace Inter with Satoshi for display, DM Sans for body.
3. Break the three-card grid. Make the first card 2x width.
...

What IS working: Your spacing scale is consistent (4px base) and the
semantic HTML structure is solid. Build on that.
```

### `/score` -- Quantified Design Quality

A single 0-100 score, broken down by category. Track it over time.

```
## Picasso Design Score: 73/100

Typography:    ████████████░░░  12/15
Color:         ████████████░░░  11/15
Spacing:       ████████░░       8/10
Accessibility: ████████████████ 16/20
Motion:        ██████░░░░       6/10
Responsive:    ████████░░       8/10
Performance:   ██████░░░░       6/10
Anti-Slop:     ██████░░░░       6/10

Top fixes for +15 points:
1. Add prefers-reduced-motion support (+4)
2. Replace #000 with tinted near-black (+3)
3. Add staggered entrance animation (+3)
4. Set max-width on body text (+3)
5. Replace outline:none with focus-visible (+2)
```

### `/steal <url>` -- Extract Any Site's Design DNA

Point at a live website and Picasso extracts its entire design language into a `.picasso.md` config.

```bash
/steal https://linear.app
```

Extracts: fonts, color palette, spacing rhythm, border-radius system, shadow style, animation patterns, layout structure. Generates a config that makes your project match that aesthetic.

### `/mood <word>` -- Instant Design System from a Word

```bash
/mood cyberpunk
```

Generates a complete design system -- palette, fonts, spacing, motion, component styling -- from a single evocative word. Works with: `cyberpunk`, `cottage`, `brutalist`, `luxury`, `editorial`, `playful`, `corporate`, `dark-tech`, `warm-saas`, `minimal`, and any combination.

### `/evolve` -- Iterative Multi-Round Refinement

Instead of generating once and hoping, Picasso proposes 3 distinct directions, lets you pick, then refines through multiple rounds:

```
Round 1: Here are 3 directions:
  A) Minimal monochrome -- Geist font, black/white, sharp corners
  B) Warm editorial -- Instrument Serif headers, terracotta accent, soft radius
  C) Dark technical -- JetBrains Mono accent, neon green, dense layout

You: B, but darker

Round 2: [implements B with darker surfaces, screenshots]
         What do you love? What's not right?

You: Love the typography. Cards need more breathing room.

Round 3: [adjusts spacing, screenshots]
         Are we there?

You: Ship it.
```

### `/compete <url>` -- Head-to-Head Design Battle

```bash
/compete https://competitor.com
```

Screenshots both sites, scores both, produces a head-to-head comparison:

```
                    You        Competitor
Typography:         72         88          ← They win (modular scale)
Color:              85         71          ← You win (better contrast)
Responsive:         90         65          ← You win (mobile-first)
Performance:        45         92          ← They win (image optimization)
Accessibility:      88         42          ← You win (focus states)
Overall:            76         72          ← You win, barely

Key gap: Their typography is stronger because they use a consistent
1.25 ratio scale. Yours has 7 different sizes with no clear ratio.
Fix this and you pull ahead significantly.
```

### `/before-after` -- Visual Transformation Report

After any `/polish` or `/redesign`, auto-generates side-by-side screenshots showing exactly what changed and why. Shareable HTML report.

### `/mood-board` -- Visual Inspiration Generator

Not sure what you want? Give Picasso 3-5 adjectives and it generates an interactive HTML mood board with color swatches, font samples, and example components in that style.

### `/design-system-sync` -- Keep Code and DESIGN.md in Sync

Detects when your code has drifted from your design system. Finds every hardcoded color that should be a token, every wrong font weight, every spacing violation. Offers one-click fix.

### `/preset <name>` -- One-Command Aesthetic

```bash
/preset linear     # Linear-inspired dark minimal
/preset stripe     # Stripe-inspired gradient editorial
/preset vercel     # Vercel-inspired black/white sharp
/preset notion     # Notion-inspired warm readable
/preset brutalist  # Raw, intentional, monospace
```

Generates `.picasso.md` + `DESIGN.md` + updates your CSS variables in one command.

| **Tool integrations** | **7 libraries** | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| **Sources consolidated** | **15+ repos** | 1 | 1 | 1 | 0-1 |

### What This Means in Practice

**Without Picasso**, your AI will:
- Default to Inter or Roboto every time
- Use purple gradients because that's what the training data looks like
- Center everything because it's the safe choice
- Ignore accessibility until someone files a complaint
- Use `transition: all 0.3s ease` and call it animated
- Produce interfaces that look like every other AI-generated UI

**With Picasso**, your AI will:
- Choose distinctive typography (Instrument Sans, Fraunces, Outfit) with proper OpenType features
- Build OKLCH palettes with tinted neutrals and the 60-30-10 rule
- Create asymmetric layouts with intentional spatial hierarchy
- Include all 8 interactive states on every element
- Hit WCAG 2.2 AA compliance by default
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms)
- Add text morphing, UI sounds, and haptic feedback where appropriate
- Generate DESIGN.md files that any AI agent can read
- Never produce the same design twice

## Configurable Settings

Three dials (1-10) control the design character:

| Setting | Low (1-3) | Mid (4-6) | High (7-10) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **DESIGN_VARIANCE** | Clean, centered, conventional | Considered asymmetry, intentional breaks | Avant-garde, overlapping, unconventional grids |
| **MOTION_INTENSITY** | Hover states and fades only | Staggered reveals, scroll-triggered, text morphing | Magnetic cursors, parallax, complex choreography |
| **VISUAL_DENSITY** | Spacious, luxury, breathing room | Balanced, structured whitespace | Dense dashboards, data-heavy, compact |

**Shortcuts:**
- "Make it premium" / "luxury" -> VISUAL_DENSITY 2-3, MOTION_INTENSITY 4-5
- "Dashboard" / "admin panel" -> VISUAL_DENSITY 7-8
- "Make it pop" / "wow factor" -> DESIGN_VARIANCE 7-8, MOTION_INTENSITY 7-8

## The Non-Negotiables

1. **No design should ever look like AI made it.** No purple gradients on white. No Inter font. No centered everything. No cards nested in cards. No gray text on colored backgrounds.
2. **Every design must have a clear aesthetic point of view.** If it could belong to any product, it belongs to none.
3. **Match implementation complexity to vision.** Maximalist designs need elaborate code. Minimalist designs need surgical precision.
4. **Text is always a design element**, never an afterthought.
5. **Every detail matters.** The shadow radius, the letter spacing, the hover transition duration, the border color in dark mode.
6. **Every interactive element needs all 8 states:** default, hover, focus, active, disabled, loading, error, success.
7. **Accessibility is not optional.** WCAG 2.2 AA compliance is the baseline, not the goal.
8. **Performance is a feature.** LCP < 2.5s, CLS < 0.1, INP < 200ms.
9. **UX writing is design.** Buttons say what they do. Errors explain how to fix. Empty states guide the next action.
10. **Vary between generations.** Never converge on the same fonts, colors, or layouts across projects.
